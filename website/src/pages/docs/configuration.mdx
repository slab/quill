Quill allows several ways to customize it to suit your needs. This section is dedicated to tweaking existing functionality. See the [Modules](/docs/modules/) section for adding new functionality and the [Themes](/docs/themes/) section for styling.


### Container

Quill requires a container where the editor will be appended. You can pass in either a CSS selector or a DOM object.

```javascript
var editor = new Quill('.editor');  // First matching element will be used
```

```javascript
var container = document.getElementById('editor');
var editor = new Quill(container);
```

```javascript
var container = $('.editor').get(0);
var editor = new Quill(container);
```

### Options

To configure Quill, pass in an options object:

```javascript
var options = {
  debug: 'info',
  modules: {
    toolbar: '#toolbar'
  },
  placeholder: 'Compose an epic...',
  readOnly: true,
  theme: 'snow'
};
var editor = new Quill('#editor', options);
```

The following keys are recognized:

#### bounds

Default: `document.body`

DOM Element or a CSS selector for a DOM Element, within which the editor's ui elements (i.e. tooltips, etc.) should be confined. Currently, it only considers left and right boundaries.

#### debug

Default: `warn`

Shortcut for [debug](/docs/api/#debug). Note `debug` is a static method and will affect other instances of Quill editors on the page. Only warning and error messages are enabled by default.

#### formats

Default: All formats

Whitelist of formats to allow in the editor. See [Formats](/docs/formats/) for a complete list.

#### modules

Collection of modules to include and respective options. See [Modules](/docs/modules/) for more information.

#### placeholder

Default: None

Placeholder text to show when editor is empty.

#### readOnly

Default: `false`

Whether to instantiate the editor to read-only mode.

#### scrollingContainer

Default: `null`

DOM Element or a CSS selector for a DOM Element, specifying which container has the scrollbars (i.e. `overflow-y: auto`), if is has been changed from the default `ql-editor` with custom CSS. Necessary to fix scroll jumping bugs when Quill is set to [auto grow](/playground/#autogrow) its height, and another ancestor container is responsible from the scrolling.

#### theme

Name of theme to use. The builtin options are "bubble" or "snow". An invalid or falsy value will load a default minimal theme. Note the theme's specific stylesheet still needs to be included manually. See [Themes](/docs/themes/) for more information.
